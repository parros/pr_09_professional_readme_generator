# Homework 9 Professional Readme Generator

## Description

I created a readme generator to quickly create a professinal readme for new projects.

## Install

Remember to type npm i on the command line in the generator directory to install Inquirer for the generator to work.

## Usage

To use the generator, type node index.js on the command line in the generator directory then you can start answering the questions to create a readme.
When you pick a license from the list, then a badge will be created at the top of the readme.
When putting in your github username, the github.com/ is already put in so put in ONLY the username such as parros.

## Credits

I got the code for the badges from https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba
